# @frontity/twentytwenty-theme

The **Twenty Twenty** default WordPress theme was included in WordPress 5.3 and we ported it over to Frontity so users can use it in a headless setup as well. You can check out its **code** and structure on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/frontity/frontity/tree/dev/packages/twentytwenty-theme) and find it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontity/twentytwenty-theme).

## Features

These are some of the key features included in this theme:

**Accessibility Ready**

The theme is accessible and screen-reader friendly. We added the proper landmarks, roles and labels. We also paid attention to trap focus within modals, ensure focus indicator is visible for all interactive elements.

**Custom Colors**

You can give your site or blog a personal touch by changing the background colors, text colors and primary/accent color in the theme settings. You change the color in one place, all visual elements get updated.

**Search**

The theme comes with a built-in search box to make it easy for your readers to look for specific content. Search box is powered by the robust and performant search engine built into WordPress.

**Featured Images**

Show beautiful featured images for your blog posts. Frontity uses the featured image uploaded to WordPress and renders it on every blog post. You can also opt out of this in the theme settings.

**Content Prefetch**

You can prefetch page for any link to provide an almost instant user experience. All you need do is to change your settings to prefetch pages when the user "hovers" on a link, when the link is visible on screen, or prefetch all links on the current page.

**Pagination**

Frontity's theme has the same pagination as the original WordPress theme. This way you can have access to different pages in the footer, and navigate easily between pages.
