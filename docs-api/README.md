Let's kick things off by providing you with a roadmap so that you can find your way around the documentation and zero in on the information you need right now.

## Frontity CLI

In the [**CLI Commands**](frontity-cli/) section you'll find info about the commands provided by the Frontity CLI that you can use to create, run and build your Frontity projects

## Packages

Frontity packages are the ingredients of your Frontity project. They're **NPM packages** in charge of a specific portion of logic required by the project \(routing, source, HTML render,.. \).

You can learn all about existing Frontity packages in the section entitled [**Frontity Packages**](frontity-packages/).

### Themes Packages

Theme are just a special instance of a Frontity package. Really **everything** is a package when you're working with Frontity.

The included themes, namely `mars-theme` and `twentytwenty-theme`, are dealt with separately from the other packages under the [**Frontity Themes**](frontity-themes/) section.

## Plugins

Sometimes a **Frontity WordPress plugin** is required so everything works smoothly. You'll find everything you need to know about them in the [**WordPress Plugins**](frontity-plugins/) section

By the way, we'd love to hear about what you're building with Frontity. Join us in our [**Community Forum**](https://community.frontity.org) and tell us about your project. You can also ask questions and get help and support from our growing community of users and developers there.
