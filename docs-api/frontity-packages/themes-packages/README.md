# ðŸŽ¨ Themes packages

Themes packages are those packages that contain the React project used to render the final output (both in client and server side)

With Frontity, you can build your own theme from scratch matching all your needs or use a ready-to-use one, which will make it much easier. You can even install a starter theme and keep working on top of that.

Basically it's the same as WordPress, just keep working as you usually do.
