# üç± Packages

Frontity projects are built around the idea of packages that encapsulates logic that can be reused across projects. Frontity packages may be considered as the equivalent of WordPress plugins. They're the ingredients of the final Frontity project.

## How to use Frontity packages

Frontity packages are available available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:frontity) and they can be installed as dependencies of your Frontity project \(as with any other Node project\).

Frontity needs to know the packages we're going to use in the project and how do we want to use them. We can set this in the file `frontity.settings.js`, where we can define and configure the packages \(by using Namespaces\) for the Frontity project

We're going to focus on the use of Frontity packages at a Frontity project level, but the same applies if you're creating a custom Frontity package. You can see more info about how to create your custom package [here](./)

## Official Frontity Packages

Official Frontity packages are those created and maintained by the [Frontity Team](https://frontity.org/about-us/).

These packages encapsulates the logic to apply the main features needed in a WordPress + React stack project managed by Frontity

A Frontity project is basically the sum of the **Core package** plus a selection of **Features packages**. We can also use **Collections packages** to help us speed up the development of our Frontity project
