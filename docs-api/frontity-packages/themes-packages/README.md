# ðŸŽ¨ Themes packages

Themes packages are those packages that contain the React project used to render the final output (in both client-side and server-side).

With Frontity, you can build your own theme from scratch to match all your project's needs, or use a ready-to-use one, which will make your work easier. You can even install a starter theme and keep working on top of it.

Basically it's the same as WordPress, just keep working as you usually do.

## Official themes
